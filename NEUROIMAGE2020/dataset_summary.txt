Multiple data sets were created, and each of them contains multiple variations. For example they all come with a zscore normalized fMRI and RV, together with  
The terms RV and RVT are used interchangeably within the code, although all out calculations currently use RV.  

Explanation of the labels in the names:

mean_norm: normalized by dividing by the mean rathr than the z score  
sliced: chopped into time windows of size 64
90: standard 90 ROI Atlas, except for parcel 90 wich is a custom made parcellation rather than the stardardized.  
headmotion: pre processing stream with head motion kept 
downsamp: data was downsampled (only version 2 was used in the paper) 
downsamp_filt: data was downsampled first and then and filtered (only version 2 was used in the paper)
92: 90 ROIs plus 2 white matter and CSF ROIs
lightprep: light pre processing stream 
268: 268 ROI Atlas 
10: custom made parcellation with 10 ROIs 
42: custom made parcellation with 42 ROIs 
parcel: custom made parcellation

-leave_participant_out_lightprep_90_zglob_linear

Varying kernel size: 
-leave_participant_out_90_zglob_kernel 
-leave_participant_out_90_zglob_kernel2

Ordinary Least Squares: 
-leave_participant_out_ols_90_zglob



OLS: Ordinary Least Squares
Parcel: parcellation done by our new method rather than the standard Atlas
Linear: single unit model

if nothing else is specified the model is a CNN. 
zglob: the signal is normalized using the "global scan Z score", pooling all samples of the scan and then calculating the standard deviation and mean over that pooling
rvz: the RV signal was z-score normalized 
headmotion: the headmotion is kept, i.e. not regressed out,
